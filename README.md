# DynamicContextMenu
Creating Dynamic Context Menus using custom a Directive

The code creates a table with two header items and 4 row items.
On clicking (left), a context menu opens. It can be easily changed for right click. 
The context menus are different for different row items - dynamically rendered by the custom directive.

I have put necessary comments in the code for clarity and have tried to keep the code clean by usng cdns for angular, bootstrap, jquery etc. instead of installing then in project for the sake of simplicity.
