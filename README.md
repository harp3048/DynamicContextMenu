# DynamicContextMenu
Creating Dynamic Context Menus using custom a Directive

The code creates a table with two header items and 4 row items.
On clicking (left), a context menu opens. It can be easily changed for right click as mentioned in the code comments.
The context menus are different for different row items - dynamically rendered by the custom directive.

I have put necessary comments in the code for clarity and have tried to keep the code clean by 
-usng cdns for angular, bootstrap, jquery etc. instead of installing them in project for the sake of simplicity
-refactored the project in different files to separate the code for controller, directive and module.
To exceute the index.html file, save all the files in same directory and open the index.html file in the browser.
